# Instructions:
# Importing Libraries:
#
# Begin by importing necessary libraries including:
#     * yfinance
#     * pandas
#     * warnings
#     * Prophet
#     * plotly.graph_objs (import OHLC for candlestick plot)
#     * sklearn.metrics
#
# Setting Up:
#
# Filter warnings to be ignored using `warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")`.
# Specify the stock ticker symbol (e.g., `^NSEBANK`).
#
# Fetching Historical Data:
#
# Attempt to fetch historical stock data for the specified ticker symbol using the `yfinance` library.
# If unsuccessful due to an invalid ticker symbol, print an error message and exit.
#
# Plotting Historical Data:
#
# Plot the historical stock data using candlestick and simple moving average (SMA) techniques.
#
# Preparing Data for Prophet:
#
# Prepare the historical stock data for use with the Prophet library:
#     * Convert the DataFrame to a suitable format.
#     * Exclude weekends.
#
# Training Prophet Model:
#
# Create and train a Prophet model using the prepared historical data.
#
# Making Future Dataframe:
#
# Generate a future DataFrame for predicting future stock prices.
#
# Predicting Future Stock Prices:
#
# Use the trained Prophet model to predict future stock prices.
#
# Plotting Predictions:
#
# Plot the actual and predicted stock prices.
#
# Real-Time Prediction Function:
#
# Define a function for real-time prediction, which continuously fetches real-time data and predicts the stock price.
# Print the predicted price every minute until interrupted by a keyboard interrupt.
#
# Performance Metrics Calculation Function:
#
# Define a function to calculate mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE) for evaluating the performance of the forecasting model.
#
# Main Function:
#
# Call the defined functions to:
#     * Fetch historical data.
#     * Prepare data for Prophet.
#     * Train the model.
#     * Make future predictions.
#     * Perform real-time prediction.
#     * Calculate performance metrics.
# Print predicted stock prices for future dates.
# Start real-time prediction.
# Calculate and print performance metrics (MAE and MSE).
#
# These instructions provide a step-by-step guide on how to analyze historical stock data, train a forecasting model, predict future stock prices, evaluate model performance, and perform real-time prediction.
